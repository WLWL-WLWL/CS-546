    <h1>How I arrived Stenvens</h1>
    <main>
        <p>Last July when I stayed in Alabama, I received my admission letter from Stevens. I was excited to get this offer but there is a problem that need to be solved, whcih is how I can get there.</p>
        <p>Due to the covid-19, I was afraid of getting infected. Taking flight is the most convient way but there is a high risk to get infected. I was wondering if it is possible to drive from Alabama to New Jersy, which will take 16 hours. I did not think
            I can drive 16 hours by myself.</p>
        <p>When I was in dilemma, my friend told me that he would like to take me to Stenvens! I was so toughed that he would like to help me in such a hard time. So we leaved at 6am and drove in turn all the way from Alabama to New Jersy. We saw the beacuty
            of different states and took lots of pictures during the trip.</p>
        <p>Finally at 11 pm, we successfuly arrived!</p>
